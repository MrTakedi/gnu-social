Now plugins can be installed via the sysadmin UI. Therefore, now you should package your plugins either in tar or zip. The
package name must be the same as the plugin's internal name. For example, a plugin
named `Chuck Norris (social@chuck.norris)` must be in a file named: `ChuckNorris.tar`.
Inside there MUST be two directories, one named 'includes' with everything that should be unpacked
in `local/plugins/{plugin_name}` and another named 'public' with everything that should be unpacked
in `public/local/plugins/{plugin_name}`.
